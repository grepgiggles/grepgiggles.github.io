Hi Dear Reader! Welcome to my blog. 
Me in a nutshell..
- I'm a giggly neuroscientist turned programmer.
- I'm really excited by the potential of IoT, home automation projects and anything Raspberry Pi related.
- In my day job as a data analyst I daydream about incorporating my love of nature and biology into a full time career in technology.
